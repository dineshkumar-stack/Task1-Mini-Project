    <h1>Mini Project On HTML & CSS</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Read the given instructions given below before doing your project</h2><hr>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> The project for your HTML & CSS will be a <code>“mini-web site”</code>. Choose a topic that
                    interests
                    you: something that excites you, something you want to tell the whole world about. If you don’t care
                    about the subject, your readers won’t either.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> I want you to concentrate on the HTML, not on finding content, so do not choose a topic that
                    requires lots of research. For example, unless are an expert about the subject, a web site about the
                    kings of Sweden will need much time-consuming research. On the other hand a website about your
                    favorite hobby won’t take much research at all.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Here are further requirements for the assignment:</h2><hr>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Your project must contain a minimum of ten original HTML5 pages (files) that you have written. A
                        single HTML5 file with links to nine pages written by other people is not acceptable. You may
                        not simply link to pages that you have practiced for the HTML & CSS. Your material must all be
                        original.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Diagram showing links among an index page and other content pages is shown in the <strong>Sample
                            linkage diagram</strong>.</p>

                    </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> You must draw a diagram showing how your HTML pages link together, and the linkage must make
                        sense.
                        For the linkage diagram you can use any online tools to draw or you can make your diagram by
                        hand
                        then scan it or take a digital photo of the diagram and upload it to the <code>GitHub</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> A linkage diagram is not the same as a diagram showing. If you have many
                        pages that are all
                        linked to each other, just draw a line that connects them all and label it with words like “all
                        linked to each other” rather than trying to draw dozens of lines with arrows on them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Implementation of your project:

                            elements, and each alt attribute must be descriptive.
                        </li>
                        <li>You must link to at least two external sites that are related to the content of your site.
